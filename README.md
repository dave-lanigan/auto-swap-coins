# auto-swap-coin [in-dev]

Due to security risks, the centralized nature and high trading fees (percent-based) of many trading plateforms, there have been several decentralized, non-custodial asset exchanges that have come to the fore. [Kyber Network](https://kyber.network/) and [ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.com/?utm_source=shapeshift_classic&utm_medium=homepage_cta) being the most popular. However, although these exchanges have API's, a fully automated transaction between token wallets two wallets, remains impossible.

On top of that, the web3.py usage is fairly complex and the barriar to entry is high and hopefully this package will reduce the complexity of making a transaction somewhat.

The hope of this package is to supply some simple classes/functions to allow for fully automated transactions from one wallet with a private key to another, using a few different possible coin swapping exchanges.
